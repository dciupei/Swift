Description:

In this Assignment all the buttons and views had to have constraints to fit any size phone or tablet without any functionality. We had to give the internal view an aspect ratio to scale the view whenever the screen size changes or is being rotated. For the buttons and text view they were set to be equal heights and widths along with the leading and trailing edges to all be equal. Therefore the calculator will adjust the size of everything when rotated or a different screen size. 

Build / Run:

To run the program open the .xcodeproj and click the play button to run the simulator. Then with the simulator open the user can rotate the phone or run the application on a different screen size.
