Description:

The game 15 puzzle is a moving tile game where the tiles have to be arranged from 1-15 to win the game. The tiles will be shuffled from the beginning and the user will be able to shuffle the board at any time. The user clicks on a tile that will move into an open spot and must get all the tiles to be arranged 1-15.

Build / Run:

To run the program open the .xcodeproj and click the play button to run the simulator. Then with the simulator open the user can rotate the phone or run the application on a different screen size.
