Description:

The game Sudoku is a game that involves the user to fill in each empty spot in the puzzle with a number between 1-9. The same number can't appear in the row, column, or block. The user can clickon a cell to either put in a value or pencil in a value. If the user wants a new game or harder version simply click on the menu button to get more puzzles.  

Build / Run:

To run the program open the .xcodeproj and click the play button to run the simulator. Then with the simulator open the user can rotate the phone or run the application on a different screen size.
