Description:

In this application I created a client iOS application for a Twitter-like service. It will use user information and messages that are stored on a server and are accessible via a web-based API using HTTP GET/POST methods. 

Build / Run:

To run the program open the .xcodeproj and click the play button to run the simulator. Then with the simulator open the user can rotate the phone or run the application on a different screen size.
